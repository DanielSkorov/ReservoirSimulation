class MultiSeparator(object):
  r"""Multiphase separator.

  The main idea behind the `MultiSeparator` is division of a separator
  logic into *streams*, each of which may undergo several separation
  *stages*. To provide the flexibility of the `MultiSeparator`, its
  program flow is governed by a user-defined code. There are three
  main keywords:

  - **def** *stream_name number_of_stages*
    This keywords allows to define the stream `stream_name: str` and
    its number of stages `number_of_stages: int`. The program starts by
    placing the given amount of the mixture of known component
    composition into the stage `0` of the stream `'main'`. Therefore,
    the `'main'` stream should always be defined. After placing some
    amount of the fluid into the stage `0` of the stream `'main'`, one
    should perform the flash procedure to split the mixture into the
    phases.

  - **flash** *stream_name stage_number prs tem*
    This keyword specifies the pressure [Pa] `prs: float` and
    temperature [K] `tmp: float`, at which the flash calculation must
    be performed for the stage `stage_number: int` of the stream
    `stream_name: str`. If there is no fluid present at the specified
    stage, the flash procedure will be skipped. Therefore, before
    running the flash, one should place some amount of the fluid into
    a stage of a stream.

  - **move** *phase_id stream_src stage_src stream_trg stage_trg*
    By using this keyword one can move the full amount the phase
    `phase_id: int` from the source stage `stage_src: int` of the
    source stream `stream_src: str` to the target stage `stage_trg: int`
    of the target stream `stream_trg: str`. If there is no amount of
    the phase, then the movement procedure will be skipped.

  Also, there are keywords that can be used to define the name of the
  gas phase stream and its stage, the name of the oil phase stream and
  its stage from which flash results will be taken to calculate phase
  properties in laboratory experiments (such as CVD, CCE, DL etc.):

  - **gasstream** *stream_name*
    This keyword specifies the `stream_name: str` of a stream that
    should be considered as the gas phase stream to calculate properties
    in laboratory experiments.

  - **gasstage** *stage_number*
    This keyword specifies the `stage_number: int` of the `gasstream`
    from which the flash results will be taken to calculate properties
    in laboratory experiments.

  - **oilstream** *stream_name*
    This keyword specifies the `stream_name: str` of a stream that
    should be considered as the oil phase stream to calculate properties
    in laboratory experiments.

  - **oilstage** *stage_number*
    This keyword specifies the `stage_number: int` of the `oilstream`
    from which the flash results will be taken to calculate properties
    in laboratory experiments.

  All these keywords are necessary only if the `labmode` is set to
  `True`.

  Parameters

    the following methods:

    - `getPT_kvguess(P: float, T: float, yi: Vector[Double])
       -> Sequence[Vector[Double]]`
      For a given pressure [Pa], temperature [K], and mole composition

      tuple that contains:

      - the compressibility factor of the mixture,
      - logarithms of fugacity coefficients of components as a

    To perform multiphase flash calculations, this instance of an
    equation of state class must have:

       -> Vector[Integer]`

    or `'qnss-newton'` then it also must have:

    - `getPT_Z_lnphii_dnj(P: float, T: float, yi: Vector[Double],
       n: float) -> tuple[float, Vector[Double], Matrix[Double]]`

      The EOS name (for proper logging).

    - `Nc: int`
      The number of components in the system.

  code: str

    string of commands, each of which should be separated from another
    by `'\n'` or `';''.

    Other arguments for the flash calculation solver. It may contain
    such arguments as `method`, `tol`, `maxiter` and others.

  Examples
  --------
  For example, let's assume that we need to repeat the separation logic
  the same as for `GasSeparator` (with default pressures and
  temperatures at the stages). Therefore, the `code` parameter should
  be:
  ```
  code = (

    'def main 4;'

class cvdPT(_labprops):
  """Two-phase constant volume depletion (CVD) experiment.

  The CVD experiment is usually performed with natural gas to simulate
  the processes encountered during the field development. The experiment
  is conducted according to the following procedure:

  1) The gas sample is prepared to ensure that its state corresponds to
     the dew point.
  2) Pressure is reduced by increasing the cell volume. Some amount of
     the condensate appears. The volume of that liquid phase is
     registered.
  3) Part of the gas is expelled from the cell until the volume of the
     cell equals the volume at the dew point.
  4) The gas collected is sent to a multistage separator to study its
     properties and composition.
  5) The process is repeated for several pressure steps.

class dlPT(_labprops):
  """Two phase differential liberation (DL) experiment.

  The DL experiment is usually performed with an oil phase to simulate
  the processes encountered during the field development. The experiment
  is conducted according to the following procedure:

  1) The oil sample is prepared to ensure that its state corresponds to
     the dew point.
  2) Pressure is reduced by increasing the cell volume. Some amount of
     the gas appears. The volume of that liquid phase is registered.
  3) All gas is expelled from the cell.
  4) The gas collected is sent to a multistage separator to study its
     properties and composition.
  5) The process is repeated for several pressure steps.

class swellPT(_labprops):
  """Two-phase swelling experiment.

  This experiment is usually conducted with oil to determine:
  1) how much gas can be dissolved in oil at specific pressures,
  2) the change in the saturation pressure with gas dissolution,
  3) the swelling factor, which is the relative increase of the volume
     of the fluid.
  4) the first-contact miscibility pressure, which is the maximum point
     of the saturation pressure vs. injection gas mole fraction curve.

  The laboratory procedure can be briefly described as follows.
  The reservoir oil is loaded in a cell, and the temperature is set at
  the reservoir temperature. The bubble point of the oil and the
  corresponding volume are measured. A small amount of gas is
  transferred into the cell. A new saturation pressure is determined
  and a new saturation volume recorded. This process is repeated until
  the upper bound of injection-gas concentration is reached.

    Before calculating properties of the gas phase (gas formation
    volume factor, condensate solubility in gas, etc.) for the current
    experiment stage, the gas mixture may undergo a series of separation
    steps, similar to what would be performed in the field. The gas and
    liquid phase compositions from the specified separation steps will
    be used to calculate properties of the gas mixture collected from
    the cell during the CVD experiment.

    a class that must have the following methods:

    - `run(yi: Vector[Double], n: float = 1.) -> SeparatorResult`
