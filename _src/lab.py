class cvdPT(object):
  """Constant volume depletion (CVD) experiment.

  The CVD experiment is usually performed with natural gas to simulate
  the processes encountered during the field development. The experiment
  is conducted according to the following procedure:

  1) The gas sample is prepared to ensure that its state corresponds to
     the dew point.
  2) Pressure is reduced by increasing the cell volume. Some amount of
     the condensate appears. The volume of that liquid phase is
     registered.
  3) Part of the gas is expelled from the cell until the volume of the
     cell equals the volume at the dew point.
  4) The gas collected is sent to a multistage separator to study its
     properties and composition.
  5) The process is repeated for several pressure steps.

class dlPT(cvdPT):
  """Differential liberation (DL) experiment.

  The DL experiment is usually performed with an oil phase to simulate
  the processes encountered during the field development. The experiment
  is conducted according to the following procedure:

  1) The oil sample is prepared to ensure that its state corresponds to
     the dew point.
  2) Pressure is reduced by increasing the cell volume. Some amount of
     the gas appears. The volume of that liquid phase is registered.
  3) All gas is expelled from the cell.
  4) The gas collected is sent to a multistage separator to study its
     properties and composition.
  5) The process is repeated for several pressure steps.

  Parameters
  ----------
  eos: PsatEosPT
    An initialized instance of a PT-based equation of state. Must have

      For a given pressure [Pa], temperature [K] and mole composition
      (`Vector` of shape `(Nc,)`), this method must generate initial
      guesses of k-values as an iterable object of `Vector` of shape
      `(Nc,)`.

      - the compressibility factor of the mixture,
      - logarithms of fugacity coefficients of components as a `Vector`

        with respect to pressure as a `Vector` of shape `(Nc,)`.

    If solution methods for the saturation pressure determination and
    flash calculations are based on Newton's method, then it also must
    have:

    - `getPT_Z_lnphii_dnj(P: Scalar, T: Scalar, yi: Vector, n: Scalar)
       -> tuple[int, Scalar, Vector, Matrix]`

        with respect to components mole numbers as a `Matrix` of shape
        `(Nc, Nc)`.

    - `getPT_Z_lnphii_dP_dnj(P: Scalar, T: Scalar, yi: Vector, n: Scalar)

      The number of components in the system.
